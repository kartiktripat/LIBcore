# LIBcore Library Management System

## ðŸ“š Purpose
The LIBcore Library Management System is designed to streamline the way libraries manage book lending, user activity, and inventory. It replaces manual systems and spreadsheets with an interactive, multi-user networked application that makes library management easy, efficient, and scalable.

This system is particularly beneficial to libraries because:
- It supports **multi-user concurrent access** via a client-server architecture.
- Users (members) and staff have **separate interfaces** tailored to their roles.
- It maintains organized **digital records** of users, books, and loan history using structured text files.
- It includes logic to track late returns and automatically update resource availability.

---

## âœ¨ Features

### âœ… Book Search
Users can view all available books in a clean tabular format with columns for ID, Title, Author, Category, and Availability.

### âœ… Check Book Status
Staff can see which books are currently checked out and which are in stock.

### âœ… Late Check
Automatically identifies books not returned by the due date and flags them as overdue.

### âœ… GUI Dashboard
- Built using `Swing`, the GUI is interactive and intuitive.
- Members can browse, borrow, and return books easily.
- Staff can manage resources, view user data, export transactions, and perform admin actions.

## ðŸš€ Usage & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ttran569/libcore.git
cd libcore
git checkout ttran569-patch-1
```

### 2. Project Structure
```
libcore/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ member/          # Member GUI and client logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MemberGUI.java, MemberClient.java
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ staff/           # Staff GUI and client logic
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ StaffGUI.java, StaffClient.java
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server/              # Server code and networking
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Server.java, ClientHandler.java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server/services/     # Business logic
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ResourceManager.java, TransactionManager.java, UserManager.java
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transactions.txt
```

### 3. How to Run
1. Start the server:
```bash
Run Server.java (Eclipse or CLI)
```

2. Run Staff or Member client on separate machines or windows:
```bash
Run StaffClient.java or MemberClient.java
```
> Clients communicate with the server via sockets.

### 4. Text Files Used
- `users.txt`: contains all user information
- `resources.txt`: contains all book records
- `transactions.txt`: contains borrow/return history

---

## ðŸ§  Code Explanation

### `ClientHandler.java`
- Core server-side logic
- Handles login, logout, view resources, borrow, return, export transactions

### `ResourceManager.java`
- Adds, edits, deletes, and checks availability of resources
- Updates `resources.txt`

### `TransactionManager.java`
- Logs all transactions
- Exports and filters overdue books

### `UserManager.java`
- Displays user data from `users.txt`

### `StaffGUI.java`
- GUI for staff
- Options to view/add books, view users, return/borrow, export logs

### `MemberGUI.java`
- GUI for members
- Simplified to borrow, return, and view available books

### `SessionManager.java`
- Handles user sessions and session expiry (future-ready)

### `AuthenticationService.java`
- Validates user login credentials from `users.txt`

---

## ðŸ‘¥ User Roles
- `STAFF`: Full access to resources and logs
- `MEMBER`: Can only borrow/return/view books

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Uses plain `.txt` files instead of a DB for simplicity
- Easily expandable to JDBC / MySQL / SQLite in the future
- Fully object-oriented, modular design using Java and Swing
